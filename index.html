								<p>My name is Travis Stanger. I'm a Junior in Computer Engineering studying at Iowa State University.</p>
								<p>I was born in Davenport, IA, where I have lived my entire life. I graduated from Davenport Central High School in June 2016, and began attending Iowa State University that August.</p>

								<p>My employment history begins in July 2015, when I began working at McDonald's at the age of 17. I began as a Crew Member, but quickly was promoted to Crew Trainer in October 2015. I worked nearly full-time during my first Summer here, and cut back to part time during the school year. Upon graduation from high school, I began working full time during Summer 2016 before I quit to head to college in August. Since graduating from high school, I have returned to work at McDonald's full time for all Summer and Winter breaks.</p>
								<p>In October 2018, my career at McDonald's officially came to a close, as I was offered an internship with Arconic, formerly known as Alcoa, at their Davenport Works Facility. During the Summer of 2019, I will be working as a Process Control Systems Engineering Intern.
